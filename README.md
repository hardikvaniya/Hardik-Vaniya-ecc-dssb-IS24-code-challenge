# Assumptions
## Backend
- Swagger UI is installed as devDependency which means it's only accessible during development not in production.
- Have not added logic for production build (TODO-Re-think about it)

# TODO
- Add Test cases
- What should be best location of swagger.js file
- Ask Aryan - what is reportWebVitals.js should it be removed?
# Backend run
cd backend && node server.js

# Frontend run
